                        Shortly after coming to Canada, our family decided to open up open up a resturnat. We started from humble beginings since 
                        our resturant started off with olny 20 tables. Even from the very begining our resturant
                        always focused on prodviding the best quality cusine, and strived to provide the best customer service possible.

                    <p>
                        With time people started noticing our resturant and buissness was booming. Customers enjoyed the atention to detail that 
                        our resturant strived for so they would always return. We were also almost always at full capacity so we 
                        were forced to get a bigger place to keep up with the demand.

                        After 50 years of operation our resturant is still going strong. To keep up with the times we have also renovated our resturant 
                        to achive a more elegant and modern look. Although our resturant has evolved a lot through out the years, our original values 
                        remain the same. We still strive to provide the best cuisine and customer service possible.
